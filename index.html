        <h2>Reimagining Real Estate with Bramble</h2>
        <p>
          <i
            >How do you design trust into a product promising to save users tens
            of thousands of dollars?</i
          >
          That was the core question guiding our team—<strong
            >Jowet, Annie, Selena, and I</strong
          >—as we tackled the redesign of Bramble’s desktop website. As a new
          AI-powered real estate brokerage with bold claims and cutting-edge
          technology, Bramble needed an interface that could communicate
          credibility and innovation while supporting users through one of
          life’s biggest financial decisions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>About Bramble</h3>
        <p>
          Bramble is a modern, AI-powered real estate brokerage that replaces
          the traditional 2–3% agent commission with a transparent flat fee. It
          offers end-to-end buying and selling services designed to maximize
          value for both sides of the transaction. On average, buyers receive a
          rebate of around $20,000—all while maintaining support from licensed
          human agents.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Key features include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>AI semantic search</strong> to match listings to user intent
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AI-generated video tours</strong> based on listing
            photographs
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flat-fee structure</strong> that promotes affordability and
            transparency
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Licensed human agents</strong> for ongoing guidance and
            support
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>Design Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          <em
            >We wanted the interface to reflect Bramble’s innovative approach
            while establishing trust</em
          >—especially for users encountering these ideas for the first time.
          Buying or selling a home is a significant decision, and we needed
          users to feel confident using a platform that challenges traditional
          norms.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Our guiding question:</strong> How can we emphasize what makes
          Bramble new and exciting, while keeping the experience grounded and
          reliable?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>We aligned on three key design goals to strike that balance:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clearly highlight the flat-fee rebate model</li>
          <li>Make search intuitive and guided</li>
          <li>Empower buyers and sellers from start to finish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Design Iterations</h2>
        <p>
          Each teammate—<strong>Rahel (me), Jowet, Annie, and Selena</strong
          >—created their own layout for Bramble’s desktop interface. We
          explored different ways to structure and style the homepage, explore
          page, and FAQ.
        </p>

          After evaluating the four distinct designs, we merged their strongest
          elements to form a cohesive and balanced desktop interface. The
          wireframe prioritized clarity, trust, and ease of navigation.

        <h2>Incorporating Feedback Into Prototype</h2>
        <p>
          <em
            >While developing our Figma prototype, we sought feedback from TAs
            to refine our vision.</em
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Feedback From TAs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We initially presented a non-scrollable homepage which felt
            overwhelming. We redesigned it into a scrollable layout, placing the
            brand message, search bar, and key differentiators up front.
          </li>
          <li>
            To clarify Bramble's use of AI, we added a dedicated AI workflow
            section to the homepage.
          </li>
          <li>
            We chose not to include visuals in the how-to guide to avoid
            overcrowding, relying on strong textual explanation instead.
          </li>
          <li>
            House cards were made more clearly clickable with an expand button.
          </li>
          <li>
            We received positive feedback on the plan to include About and Sell
            pages in the hi-fi prototype.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>Developing the High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>

        <h3>CEO Insights</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Suggested using a more versatile secondary color; Bramble berry
            works better as an accent than a background.
          </li>
          <li>
            Recommended clarifying search bar functionality and highlighting
            search modes (address, link, natural language).
          </li>
          <li>
            Suggested simplifying filters and expanded home view UI for clarity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Encouraged use of visual enhancements and exploring video
            integration on property displays.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>Planned Improvements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Build out the Sellers page to include seller-side workflows (limited
            feedback from CEO on this).
          </li>
          <li>Add more listings to encourage AI feature engagement.</li>
          <li>Make search and filter functionality fully interactive.</li>
          <li>
            Implement the CEO’s visual and usability suggestions if given more
            time.

        <h3>Findings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Users repeatedly tried to use the inactive search bar and wanted
            more advanced filters (e.g., schools nearby).
          </li>
          <li>
            AI functionality was intriguing but not clearly surfaced—many users
            missed or skipped the explanatory section.
          </li>
          <li>
            Despite some non-functional elements, all users successfully
            navigated to a listing and completed the task. Aesthetic and layout
            were consistently praised.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout our iterative design process, our team—<strong
            >Jowet, Annie, Selena, and I</strong
          >—learned to balance user needs with business goals and embrace design
          feedback loops. Key takeaways include:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            We merged diverse ideas into a wireframe that aligned with Bramble’s
            mission.
          </li>
          <li>
            We made layout and clarity changes after TA feedback (e.g.,
            scrollable homepage, more intuitive cards).
          </li>
          <li>
            We clarified AI integration after user confusion, adding a dedicated
            section informed by a CEO interview.
          </li>
          <li>
            User testing validated usability and helped refine interactive
            priorities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Final feedback from the CEO confirmed that we accurately conveyed
            Bramble’s value and mission.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Had we more time, we would continue developing interactivity, iterate
          on the color palette, and focus on filter functionality. Above all,
          this project showed us the value of user-centered iteration and
          responsiveness to critique.
